# fall20-araldortogul

GitHub repository of my progress journal for the course **IE 360: Statistical Forecasting and Time Series**.
The repository includes the R code that I have written for my homework as well as the data I have worked on and my Rmd (R markdown) files to generate my report.

My journal can be seen [here](https://bu-ie-360.github.io/fall20-araldortogul/).
